# The P vs NP Problem

This file formalizes the P vs NP problem, one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems
established by the Clay Mathematics Institute. It follows Cook's Clay problem description:
`Problems/PvsNP/references/clay/pvsnp.pdf`.

The reference PDF is included in this repo under `Problems/PvsNP/references/clay/`.

Note: the Clay PDF also mentions standard *external* results and examples (e.g. AKS: `PRIME ∈ P`,
Cook–Levin: `SAT` is NP-complete). Those results are not yet formalized here; this file focuses on
the definitions and the Clay statement itself.

## Overview

The P vs NP problem asks whether every language accepted by some nondeterministic algorithm
in polynomial time is also accepted by some deterministic algorithm in polynomial time.

- P refers to polynomial time: problems solvable in polynomial time
- NP refers to nondeterministic polynomial time: equivalently, problems verifiable in polynomial time

## Examples

These are narrative examples from the Clay PDF; they are not currently present as Lean theorems in
this repository.

Examples of problems in P:
- Determining if a number is prime (AKS algorithm)
- Reachability in a directed graph (PATH)

Examples of problems in NP:
- Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT)
- Traveling salesman problem (TSP)
- Integer factorization
- Graph coloring

Examples of NP-Complete problems:
- Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT)
- Traveling salesman decision problem
- Vertex cover problem
- Subset sum problem

## Importance

If P = NP, many currently intractable computational problems would become efficiently solvable,
with profound implications for cryptography, optimization, and artificial intelligence.
Most computer scientists believe that P ≠ NP.

  A language (decision problem) is a predicate on strings.
  We treat this abstractly as a predicate on some input type `α`, together with a choice
  of finite encoding `ea : FinEncoding α` that plays the role of the input alphabet.

  **Important:** The polynomial-time bound is measured with respect to the *length of the
  encoded representation* `(ea.encode a).length`, not the abstract object size. This is the
  standard computer science convention where complexity is measured in bits.

  In computational complexity theory, decision problems are typically
  formulated as languages - sets of strings that satisfy a certain property.

  Examples:
  - SAT: The set of all satisfiable Boolean formulas
  - PRIME: The set of all prime numbers (encoded as strings)
  - HAMPATH: The set of all graphs containing a Hamiltonian path

def Language (α : Type) := α → Prop

/--
  The class P consists of languages decidable in polynomial time
  by a deterministic Turing machine.

  A language is in P if there exists a polynomial-time algorithm
  that can determine whether a given input belongs to the language.

  **Encoding & Complexity:** The time bound applies to computation on the *encoded string*
  `(ea.encode a)`, which is standard in complexity theory. Different encodings can differ
  by polynomial factors but are considered equivalent for the P vs NP question.

  Examples in P:
  - Checking if a number is prime (AKS algorithm)
  - Finding shortest paths in a graph (Dijkstra's algorithm)
  - Linear programming
  - 2-SAT (2-variable per clause satisfiability)

  **Definition:** The decision function `f : α → Bool` must be computable by `TM2` in time
  polynomial in `(ea.encode a).length` (the encoded input size).

  Create an encoding for pairs based on individual encodings.

  This allows us to encode pairs of objects (α × β) using
  the encodings for individual types α and β.

  The approach:
  1. Combine alphabets using Sum type
  2. Encode pairs by mapping elements through Sum.inl or Sum.inr
  3. Decode by separating elements and using original decoders

  This encoding is crucial for defining verification in NP problems
  where we need to handle both the input and its certificate.

A checking relation `R` is *polynomial-time* if the associated language
`L_R = { w#y | R(w, y) }` is in `P` (Cook's Clay problem description).

  NP-Completeness: A language is NP-complete if it's in NP and
  every NP language reduces to it in polynomial time.

  NP-complete problems represent the "hardest" problems in NP.
  If any NP-complete problem can be solved in polynomial time,
  then P = NP.

  Examples of NP-complete problems:
  - Boolean satisfiability (SAT): The first proven NP-complete problem (Cook-Levin theorem)
  - 3-SAT: Boolean satisfiability with 3 literals per clause
  - Hamiltonian circuit problem: Finding a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once
  - Clique problem: Finding a complete subgraph of a given size
  - Vertex cover: Finding a set of vertices that covers all edges

  Most computer scientists believe this statement is true, meaning
  that some problems are fundamentally harder to solve than to verify.

  - Current cryptographic systems remain secure
  - Creative activity like finding mathematical proofs requires insight
    that cannot be fully automated
