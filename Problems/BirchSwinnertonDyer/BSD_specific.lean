# Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture Formulation by Jz Pan [https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#user/366779]

This file presents a technically precise formulation of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture
that differs from my original formulation in several key ways:

1. **Focus on "Fake" L-function**: It explicitly works with a "fake" Hasse-Weil L-function,
   acknowledging that this might differ from the mathematically correct one by finitely many
   Euler factors, but has the same analytic properties relevant to the conjecture.

2. **Scope Limitation**: This version focuses only on elliptic curves over ℚ (through base change
   from curves over ℤ), whereas my formulation considered curves over general number fields.

3. **Component Emphasis**: This formulation emphasizes the rank part of the BSD conjecture without
   including the more complex leading coefficient formula that my version included.

4. **Direct Use of Structures**: Instead of defining a separate EllipticCurve type, this works
   directly with WeierstrassCurve and its associated structures from mathlib.

## Note: Partial Formulation

This file provides the **rank part** of the BSD conjecture. The full Clay Millennium Prize statement
also requires the **refined leading coefficient formula**:

  c* = |Sha| · R · Ω · ∏cₚ / |E(ℚ)_tors|²

where:
- |Sha| is the order of the Tate-Shafarevich group
- R is the regulator (determinant of the height pairing)
- Ω is the real period of E
- cₚ are the Tamagawa numbers
- |E(ℚ)_tors| is the order of the torsion subgroup

These components are not yet fully formalized in Mathlib and require additional infrastructure
for the Tate-Shafarevich group, Néron-Tate heights, and Tamagawa factor definitions.

section Int

variable (W : WeierstrassCurve ℤ)

/-- The *fake* **Hasse-Weil L-function** of a Weierstrass curve over `ℤ`.
Since the Weierstrass curve is not necessarily a global minimal model, it misses finitely many
Euler factors compared to the mathematically correct one, namely, it is `L(E,s) * ∏ p, fₚ(p⁻ˢ)`
for some finitely many `p`. Since `fₚ(p⁻ˢ)` is entire, this function is also entire.
Since `fₚ(p⁻ˢ)` has no zeros on reals, the order of zeroes of this function on reals is the same
as the actual L-function. -/

/-- The **rank part of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture** for elliptic curves over `ℚ`.
It is stated as that for any Weierstrass curve over `ℤ` with non-zero discriminant, the
Mordell-Weil group of the corresponding elliptic curve over `ℚ` is finitely generated,
and its *fake* L-function has an analytic continuation to the whole complex plane,
whose order of zeroes at `1` is equal to the Mordell-Weil rank.

**Note:** This is a **partial formulation** (rank part only). The full Clay statement also includes
the refined leading coefficient formula relating the first derivative of the completed L-function
at `s = 1` to the arithmetic invariants listed in the module documentation. -/
